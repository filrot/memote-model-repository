Exchange reactions, often represented as\n    'R_EX_', can operate in the negative (uptake) direction or positive\n    (secretion) direction. By convention, a negative flux through an exchange\n    reaction represents uptake of the corresponding metabolite, and a positive\n    flux represent discharge.'

The default cutoff for ln_gamma of 3\n\"corresponds to allowing concentrations to span three orders of magnitude\naround 100 μM (~3 μM—3 mM)\" at \"pH = 7, I = 0.1 M and T = 298 K\". This\nmeans that a reaction is considered irreversible if the concentration of\nan individual metabolite would have to change more than three orders of\nmagnitude i.e. from 3 µM to 3 mM to reverse the direction of flux. For\nfurther information on the thermodynamic and implementational details\nplease refer to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts317 and\nhttps://gitlab.com/elad.noor/equilibrator-api/tree/master.\n\nPlease note that currently eQuilibrator can only determine the\nreversibility index for chemically and redox balanced reactions whose\nmetabolites can be mapped to KEGG compound IDs (e.g. C00001). In addition\nto not being mappable to KEGG or the reaction not being balanced,\nthere is a possibility that the metabolite cannot be broken down into\nchemical groups which is essential for the calculation of Gibbs energy\nusing component contributions. This test collects each exceptional reaction\nand returns them as a tuple containing each list in the following order:\n    1. Reactions with incorrect **rev**ersibility\n    2. Reactions with incomplete **mapping** to KEGG\n    3. Reactions with Metabolites that are problematic\n       during **calc**ulation\n    4. Chemically or redox un**bal**anced Reactions (after mapping to KEGG)\n\nThis test simply reports the number of metabolic reactions that disagree\nwith thermodynamic calculations i.e. are irreversible even though they\nshould not be (and vice versa), considering the above fluctuations of\nmetabolite concentrations. It does not have a mandatory 'pass' criterium.",

The currently selection is\nlisted in `annotation.py`, but an ongoing discussion can be found at\nhttps://github.com/opencobra/memote/issues/332. For each database this\ntest checks for the presence of its corresponding namespace ID to comply\nwith the MIRIAM guidelines i.e. they have to match those defined on\nhttps://identifiers.org/.\n\nSince each database is quite different and some potentially incomplete, it\nmay not be feasible to achieve 100% coverage for each of them. Generally\nit should be possible, however, to obtain cross-references to at least\none of the databases for all gene products consistently.",

Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.",
