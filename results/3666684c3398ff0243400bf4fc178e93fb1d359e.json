Many gap-filling algorithms attempt to minimise the number of\nadded reactions. This can lead to many biomass precursors being\n\"direct metabolites\".\n\nThis test reports the ratio of direct metabolites to the total amount of\nprecursors to a given biomass reaction. It specifically looks for\nmetabolites that are only in either exchange, transport or biomass\nreactions. Bear in mind that this may lead to false positives in heavily\ncompartimentalized models.\n\nTo pass this test, the ratio of direct metabolites should be less than 50%\nof all biomass precursors. This is an arbitrary threshold but it takes\ninto account that while certain ions do not serve a relevant metabolic\nfunction, it may still be important to include them in the biomass\nreaction to account for the impact of their uptake energy costs.\n\nThis threshold is subject to change in the future.",

The Systems Biology\n    Ontology defines a sink reaction as follows: 'A modeling process to\n    provide matter influx or efflux to a model, for example to replenish a\n    metabolic network with raw materials (eg carbon / energy sources). Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.",
