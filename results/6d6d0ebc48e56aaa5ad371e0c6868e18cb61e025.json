It might not be a problem for ions or\nmetabolites for which the organism in question is auxotrophic. However,\ntoo many of these metabolites may be artifacts of automated gap-filling\nprocedures. Many gap-filling algorithms attempt to minimise the number of\nadded reactions. This can lead to many biomass precursors being\n\"direct metabolites\".\n\nThis test reports the ratio of direct metabolites to the total amount of\nprecursors to a given biomass reaction. It specifically looks for\nmetabolites that are only in either exchange, transport or biomass\nreactions. Bear in mind that this may lead to false positives in heavily\ncompartimentalized models.\n\nTo pass this test, the ratio of direct metabolites should be less than 50%\nof all biomass precursors. This is an arbitrary threshold but it takes\ninto account that while certain ions do not serve a relevant metabolic\nfunction, it may still be important to include them in the biomass\nreaction to account for the impact of their uptake energy costs.\n\nThis threshold is subject to change in the future.",

      "summary": "If a reaction is neither a transport reaction, a biomass reaction nor a\nboundary reaction, it is counted as a purely metabolic reaction.\nThis test checks if the reversibility attribute of each reaction\nin a list of cobrapy reactions agrees with a thermodynamics-based\ncalculation of reversibility. To determine reversibility we calculate\nthe reversibility index ln_gamma of each reaction\nusing the eQuilibrator API. The default cutoff for ln_gamma of 3\n\"corresponds to allowing concentrations to span three orders of magnitude\naround 100 μM (~3 μM—3 mM)\" at \"pH = 7, I = 0.1 M and T = 298 K\". This\nmeans that a reaction is considered irreversible if the concentration of\nan individual metabolite would have to change more than three orders of\nmagnitude i.e. from 3 µM to 3 mM to reverse the direction of flux. For\nfurther information on the thermodynamic and implementational details\nplease refer to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts317 and\nhttps://gitlab.com/elad.noor/equilibrator-api/tree/master.\n\nPlease note that currently eQuilibrator can only determine the\nreversibility index for chemically and redox balanced reactions whose\nmetabolites can be mapped to KEGG compound IDs (e.g. C00001). In addition\nto not being mappable to KEGG or the reaction not being balanced,\nthere is a possibility that the metabolite cannot be broken down into\nchemical groups which is essential for the calculation of Gibbs energy\nusing component contributions. This test collects each exceptional reaction\nand returns them as a tuple containing each list in the following order:\n    1. Reactions with incorrect **rev**ersibility\n    2. Reactions with incomplete **mapping** to KEGG\n    3. Reactions with Metabolites that are problematic\n       during **calc**ulation\n    4. Chemically or redox un**bal**anced Reactions (after mapping to KEGG)\n\nThis test simply reports the number of metabolic reactions that disagree\nwith thermodynamic calculations i.e. are irreversible even though they\nshould not be (and vice versa), considering the above fluctuations of\nmetabolite concentrations. It does not have a mandatory 'pass' criterium.",

The Systems Biology\n    Ontology defines a sink reaction as follows: 'A modeling process to\n    provide matter influx or efflux to a model, for example to replenish a\n    metabolic network with raw materials (eg carbon / energy sources). Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.",
