The currently selection is\nlisted in `annotation.py`, but an ongoing discussion can be found at\nhttps://github.com/opencobra/memote/issues/332. For each database this\ntest checks for the presence of its corresponding namespace ID to comply\nwith the MIRIAM guidelines i.e. they have to match those defined on\nhttps://identifiers.org/.\n\nSince each database is quite different and some potentially incomplete, it\nmay not be feasible to achieve 100% coverage for each of them.

Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this.
