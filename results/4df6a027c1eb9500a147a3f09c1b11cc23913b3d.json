Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a  physical correspondence. Exchange reactions, often represented as\n    'R_EX_', can operate in the negative (uptake) direction or positive\n    (secretion) direction. By convention, a negative flux through an exchange\n    reaction represents uptake of the corresponding metabolite, and a positive\n    flux represent discharge.' Every exchange reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Exchange reactions differ from demand reactions in that the\n    metabolites are removed from or added to the extracellular\n    environment only.",

The Systems Biology\n    Ontology defines a sink reaction as follows: 'A modeling process to\n    provide matter influx or efflux to a model, for example to replenish a\n    metabolic network with raw materials (eg carbon / energy sources). Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.",
