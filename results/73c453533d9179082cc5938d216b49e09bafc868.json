Hence, this test reports how many\nof these reactions, which transports metabolites from one compartment\nto another, have fixed constraints. This test does not have any mandatory\n'pass' criteria.\n\nA transport reaction is defined as follows:\n1. It contains metabolites from at least 2 compartments and\n2. at least 1 metabolite undergoes no chemical reaction, i.e.,\nthe formula and/or annotation stays the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nA notable exception is transport via PTS, which also contains the following\nrestriction:\n3. The transported metabolite(s) are transported into a compartment through\nthe exchange of a phosphate.\n\nAn example of transport via PTS would be\npep(c) + glucose(e) -> glucose-6-phosphate(c) + pyr(c)\n\nReactions similar to transport via PTS (referred to as \"modified transport\nreactions\") follow a similar pattern:\nA(x) + B-R(y) -> A-R(y) + B(y)\n\nSuch modified transport reactions can be detected, but only when a formula\nfield exists for all metabolites in a particular reaction. If this is not\nthe case, transport reactions are identified through annotations, which\ncannot detect modified transport reactions.",

To determine reversibility we calculate\nthe reversibility index ln_gamma of each reaction\nusing the eQuilibrator API.

For\nfurther information on the thermodynamic and implementational details\nplease refer to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts317 and\nhttps://gitlab.com/elad.noor/equilibrator-api/tree/master.\n\nPlease note that currently eQuilibrator can only determine the\nreversibility index for chemically and redox balanced reactions whose\nmetabolites can be mapped to KEGG compound IDs (e.g. C00001). In addition\nto not being mappable to KEGG or the reaction not being balanced,\nthere is a possibility that the metabolite cannot be broken down into\nchemical groups which is essential for the calculation of Gibbs energy\nusing component contributions.

The Systems Biology\n    Ontology defines a sink reaction as follows: 'A modeling process to\n    provide matter influx or efflux to a model, for example to replenish a\n    metabolic network with raw materials (eg carbon / energy sources). Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.",
